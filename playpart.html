        Mrs. Stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). Ah, good
evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!<br>

Peter Stockmann. I happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the
dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.<br>

Mrs. Stockmann (a little embarrassed). Oh, no—it was quite by chance
he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too?<br>

Peter Stockmann. I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!
Not with my digestion.<br>

Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, but just once in a way—<br>

Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
economical, too.<br>

Mrs. Stockmann (smiling). Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
spendthrifts.
