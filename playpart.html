        <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6>
        <p class="direction">(coming forward into the sitting-room).</p>
        <p class="speech">Ah, good evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us</p>
        
        <h6 class="PeterStockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h6>
        <p>I happened to be passing, and so—</p>
        <p class="direction">(looks into the dining-room).</p> 
        <p class="speech">But you have company with you, I see.</p>

        <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> 
        <p class="direction">(a little embarrassed).</p>
        <p class="speech">Oh, no—it was quite by chance he came in.</p> 
        <p class="direction">(Hurriedly.)</p>  
        <p class="speech">Won't you come in and have something, too?</p>

        <h6 class="PeterStockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night! Not with my digestion.</p>

        <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Oh, but just once in a way—</p>

        <h6 class="PeterStockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h6>
        <p class="speech">No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more economical, too.</p>

        <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6>
        <p class="direction">(smiling)</p>
        <p class="speech">Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are spendthrifts.</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.</p>

        <h6 class="PeterStockmann">Peter Stockmann</h6> 
        <p class="direction">(bowing a little distantly).</p>
        <p class="speech">Good evening. You have come on business, no doubt.</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Partly. It's about an article for the paper.</p>

        <h6 class="PeterStockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h6>
        <p class="speech">So I imagined. I hear my brother has become a prolific contributor to the "People's Messenger."</p>
        
        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Yes, he is good enough to write in the "People's Messenger" when he has any home truths to tell.</p>
        
        <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6>
        <p class="direction">(to HOVSTAD).</p>
        <p class="speech">But won't you—?</p>
        <p class="direction">(Points to the dining-room.)</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I quite agree with you.</p>
